# yale-proxy
This code is a proxy to the undocumented Yale Smart Hub API. I created this to be able to integrate the Yale doorman and other components into my custom Home Operating System - Anorak.

Feel free to use this in your project, but be warned, it may (most likeley) fail at any time. Partly or fully.

Happy hacking!
